This application uses:

- JPA (Java Persistence Api)
- EJB (Enterprise Java Beans)
- Primefaces
- MVC

## Requirements ðŸ’»

- You need to create a persistence called "SgaPU" and a datasource "jdbc/PersonaDb", or just change their names in the file persistence.xml
- you could change the way to connect to the database, but remember the project works with JPA.
